Yash has a sequence of 26 distinct numbers P = (P1, P2, ..., P26), where the numbers from 1 to 26 are in random order.
Ashok, one of Yash's friends, challenged him to construct a string S using the following table:

Numbers   1 2 3 4 - - - 26
Alphabets a b c d - - - z

Every number from 1 to 26 represents an alphabet as shown in above table.
Yash should construct a string based on the alphabet numbers. Help Yash construct the string S.

Write a program that reads the space-separated numbers and prints the resultant string S.

Input
The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers representing the sequence of 26 distinct numbers P = (P1, P2, ..., P26).
Output
The output should be a single line containing a string obtained by constructing a string based on the alphabet numbers.
Explanation
Test Case: If the given P = 213 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26,

The P1=2
The number 2 is represented by alphabet b 
so the second character of S is b.

The P1=1
The number 1 is represented by alphabet a
so the second character of S is a.

Using above procedure, we obtain the result
