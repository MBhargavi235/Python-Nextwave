Shikhar has two integers S and T. He wants to count all possible triplets of non-negative integers (a,b,c) which
satisfy the below conditions:
a + b + c <= S and a x b x c <= T

Your task is to help Shikhar by finding the count of such triplets.

Write a program that reads the two space-separated numbers S and T, and prints the count of 
triplets of non-negative integers (a,b,c) satisfying the above conditions.

Note: A group of three, considered as a unit is known as triplet.
