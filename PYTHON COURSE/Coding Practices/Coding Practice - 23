Question: Sum of Numbers in the List
Given space-separated numbers, write a program to print the sum of the given numbers.

Input
The input will be a single line containing space-separated integers.

Output
The output should be a single line containing an integer that is the sum of the given numbers.

Explanation
For example, if the given space-separated numbers are 3 4 7 8,

The given numbers are 3, 4, 7, and 8.
The sum of 3, 4, 7, and 8 is 22. (3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 22)
The output should be 22.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input and split the numbers.
Convert the numbers to integers and store them in a new list.
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list.
Print the sum of the numbers.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers

First, we need to read the input line containing space-separated integers. We can use the input() function 
to read the input. Then, we will use the split() function to split the input line into a list of strings.

Step 2: Convert the numbers to integers and store them in a new list

Now, we will create a new empty list called new_list. We will use a for loop to iterate through each 
number in the numbers_list. Inside the loop, we will convert each number from a string to an integer
using the int() function. Then, we will add the converted integer to the new_list.

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the numbers in the list

After converting all the numbers to integers and storing them in the new_list, we can calculate the sum
of the numbers using the sum() function.

PYTHON
Step 4: Print the sum of the numbers

Finally, we will print the sum of the numbers using the print() function.

Here is the complete solution for the problem:

Solution:

numbers_list = input().split()
new_list = []

for each_number in numbers_list:
    number = int(each_number)
    new_list += [number]
    
sum_of_numbers = sum(new_list)

print(sum_of_numbers)

So the output should be 5.

Sample Input 1

2,3,-1,5

Sample Output 1

Question: Largest Number in the List - 2
Write a program to print the largest number in the list. The input will be a single line containing 
the comma-separated integers. The output should be a single line containing the largest number in the list.

For example, if the given string is "2,4,-1,5", your code should print the largest number in the list. 
So the output should be 5.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input and split the numbers.
Convert the numbers to integers.
Sort the list of numbers.
Find the largest number and print it.
Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input and split the numbers

First, we need to read the input, which is a single line containing comma-separated integers. We can use
the input() function to read the input. Then, we will split the input string into a list of numbers using
the split() function with a comma (,) as the separator.

Step 2: Convert the numbers to integers

Now, we have a list of numbers as strings. We need to convert each number in the list to an integer.
We can use a for loop to iterate through the list and the int() function to convert each number to an integer.

Step 3: Sort the list of numbers
Next, we need to sort the list of numbers in ascending order. We can use the sorted() function to sort the list.

Step 4: Find the largest number and print it

Finally, we can find the largest number in the sorted list by selecting the last element of the list
(since it is sorted in ascending order). We can use the index -1 to access the last element of the list. 
Then, we will print the largest number using the print() function.

Here is the complete solution for the problem:

Solution:

numbers = input()
nums_list = numbers.split(",")

length_of_nums_list = len(nums_list)
for i in range(length_of_nums_list):
    nums_list[i] = int(nums_list[i])

nums_list = sorted(nums_list)
largest_number = nums_list[-1]
print(largest_number)

3. Smallest Number in the List - 2

Write a program to print the smallest number in the list.

Input

The input will be a single line containing the comma-separated integers.

Output

The output should be a single line containing the smallest number in the list.

Explanation

For example, if the given string is "2,4,-1,5", your code should print the smallest number in the list. 
So the output should be -1.

Sample Input 1

2,3,-1,5

Sample Output 1

-1

Sample Input 2

30,52,24,19

Sample Output 2
