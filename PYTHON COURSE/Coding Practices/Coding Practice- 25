01. Identify the Mistake - Sum of First N Natural Numb

Write a program to recursively compute the sum of the numbers from 1 to N.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing a positive integer (N).

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the sum of the first N natural numbers.

Explanation:

For example, if the given N is 4, your code should print the sum of numbers from 1 to 4. So the output should be 10.

Sample Input 1:

4

Sample Ouput 1:

10

Sample Input 2:

5

Sample Output 2:

15

Question: Identify the Mistake - Sum of First N Natural Numbers
Write a program to recursively compute the sum of the numbers from 1 to N.

Input: The input will be a single line containing a positive integer (N).

Output: The output should be a single line containing the sum of the first N natural numbers.

Explanation: For example, if the given N is 4, your code should print the sum of numbers from 1 to 4. 
So the output should be 10.

Approach

To solve this problem, we will use a recursive function to compute the sum of the numbers from 1 to N.
We will follow these steps:

Define a recursive function sum_of_numbers that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.
Read the input value num and call the function sum_of_numbers with num as the argument.
Print the result returned by the function.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Define the Recursive Function
First, we need to define a recursive function sum_of_numbers that takes an integer n as input and returns 
the sum of the numbers from 1 to n. The function should have a base case when n is 1, and it should return 1. 
For other values of n, the function should return the sum of n and the result of calling itself with n-1 as the argument.

Step 2: Read the Input and Call the Function
Now, we need to read the input value representing the positive integer N. We can use the input() function
to read the input and int() to convert it into an integer. Then, we will call the sum_of_numbers function 
with the input value num as the argument and store the result in a variable called result.

Step 3: Print the Result
Finally, we need to print the result returned by the sum_of_numbers function. We can use the print() function 
to display the result on the screen.

Here is the complete solution for the problem:

Solution:

def sum_of_numbers(n):
    if n == 0:  # Base case
        return 0
    else:
        return n + sum_of_numbers(n-1)  # Recursion


num = int(input())
result = sum_of_numbers(num)
print(result)
