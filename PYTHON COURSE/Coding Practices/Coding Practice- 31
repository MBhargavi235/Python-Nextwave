01. Add a Key

For this problem, the prefilled code will contain a dictionary. Write a program to add a key-value pair to the dictionary.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing the strings, separated by space, denoting the key-value pair.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the dictionary with the added key-value pair.

Explanation:

For example, if the given string is "Ramesh Cricket", your code should add the key 
"Ramesh" and the value for it should be"Cricket". 

So the output should be:

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Vani': 'Tennis', 'Rahim': 'Cricket', 'Ramesh': 'Cricket'}

Sample Input 1:

Ramesh Cricket

Sample Output 1:

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Vani': 'Tennis', 'Rahim': 'Cricket', 'Ramesh': 'Cricket'}

Sample Input 2:

Suresh Chess

Sample Output 2:

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Vani': 'Tennis', 'Rahim': 'Cricket', 'Suresh': 'Chess'}

Question: Add a Key
In this problem, you are given a dictionary with some key-value pairs. Your task is to write a program 
that adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary.

Input: A single line containing two strings, separated by a space, representing the key-value pair.

Output: A single line containing the updated dictionary with the added key-value pair.

Example: If the given input is "Ramesh Cricket", your code should add the key 
"Ramesh" and the value "Cricket" to the dictionary. 
The output should be:

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Vani': 'Tennis', 'Rahim': 'Cricket', 'Ramesh': 'Cricket'}

Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

Read the input key-value pair.
Add the key-value pair to the dictionary.
Print the updated dictionary.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input
First, we need to read the input key-value pair. We can use the input() function to read the input and split() 
to separate the key and value.

Step 2: Add the key-value pair to the dictionary
Now that we have the key and value, we can add them to the dictionary. To do this, we can use the following code:

This code adds the key-value pair to the students_dict dictionary.

Step 3: Print the updated dictionary
Finally, we need to print the updated dictionary. We can do this using the print() function:

This code prints the updated dictionary with the added key-value pair.

Here's the complete solution for the problem:

This code reads the input key-value pair, adds it to the dictionary, and prints the updated dictionary.


Solution:

students_dict = {
    "Ram": "Cricket",
    "Naresh": "Football",
    "Vani": "Tennis",
    "Rahim": "Cricket"
}

key, value = input().split()
students_dict[key] = value
print(students_dict)

02. Update a Value of Key

For this problem, the prefilled code will contain a dictionary. Write a program to update the value of a given key.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing the strings, separated by space, denoting the key-value pair.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the dictionary with the updated value to the given key.

Explanation:

For example, if the given string is "Rahim Hockey", your code should update the key 
"Rahim" with the value "Hockey". 

So the output should be

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Vani': 'Tennis', 'Rahim': 'Hockey', 'Deepak': 'Boxing'}

Sample Input 1:

Rahim Hockey

Sample Output 1:

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Vani': 'Tennis', 'Rahim': 'Hockey', 'Deepak': 'Boxing'}

Sample Input 2:

Vani Badminton

Sample Output 2:

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Vani': 'Badminton', 'Rahim': 'Cricket', 'Deepak': 'Boxing'}

Question: Update Value of Key
Approach
Step 1: Read the input key-value pair
Step 2: Update the dictionary with the given key-value pair
Step 3: Print the updated dictionary

Question: Update Value of Key
In this problem, you are given a dictionary with some key-value pairs. Your task is to write a program 
that updates the value of a given key in the dictionary.

Approach

To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1.Read the input key-value pair.
2.Update the dictionary with the given key-value pair.
3.Print the updated dictionary.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input key-value pair
First, you need to read the input key-value pair. The input will be a single line containing two strings 
separated by a space. You can use the input() function to read the input and split() to separate the strings into a list.

Step 2: Update the dictionary with the given key-value pair
Now that you have the key and value, you can update the dictionary. To do this, you can simply assign 
the value to the key in the dictionary.

Step 3: Print the updated dictionary
Finally, you can print the updated dictionary using the print() function.


Solution:

students_dict = {
    "Ram": "Cricket",
    "Naresh": "Football",
    "Vani": "Tennis",
    "Rahim": "Cricket",
    "Deepak": "Boxing"
}

# Write your code here
key, value=input().split()
students_dict[key]=value
print(students_dict)

03. Remove a Key

For this problem, the prefilled code will contain a dictionary. Write a program to remove a key.

Input: 

The input will be a single line containing a string, denoting the key to be removed.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the dictionary without the given key and its value.

explanation:

For example, if the given string is "Vani", your code should print the dictionary without the key-value 
pair of "Vani" 

So the output should be

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Rahim': 'Cricket', 'Deepak': 'Boxing'}

Sample Input 1:

Vani

Sample Output 1:

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Rahim': 'Cricket', 'Deepak': 'Boxing'}

Sample Input 2:

Rahim

Sample Output 2:

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Vani': 'Tennis', 'Deepak': 'Boxing'}

Question: Remove a Key
Approach
Step 1: Read the input key
Step 2: Remove the key from the dictionary
Step 3: Print the updated dictionary

Question: Remove a Key
In this problem, you are given a dictionary with student names as keys and their favorite sports as values. 
Your task is to write a program that removes a given key (student name) from the dictionary.

Approach
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1.Read the input key (student name) that needs to be removed.
2.Remove the key from the dictionary.
3.Print the updated dictionary without the removed key and its value.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input key
First, we need to read the input key (student name) that we want to remove from the dictionary. 
We can use the input() function to read the input and store it in a variable called key.

Step 2: Remove the key from the dictionary
Now that we have the key to remove, we can use the del keyword to remove the key and its value from the dictionary. 
We will use the variable students_dict to store the given dictionary.

Step 3: Print the updated dictionary

Finally, we need to print the updated dictionary without the removed key and its value. We can use the print()
function to do this.

Solution:

students_dict = {
    "Ram": "Cricket",
    "Naresh": "Football",
    "Vani": "Tennis",
    "Rahim": "Cricket",
    "Deepak": "Boxing"
}

# Write your code here
a=input()
del students_dict[a]
print(students_dict)

04. Sports Data

A college is conducting its annual sports meet. So they need data of students with the sport they play. 
Each student can participate in only one sport.

For this problem, the prefilled code will contain a dictionary. Write a program to add a list of tuples 
to the dictionary as key-value pairs.

If a student's name appears more than once, update the latest sport entry.

Input: 

The first line of input will contain an integer N, denoting the number of key-value pairs.
The next N lines will contain space-separated strings, denoting key followed by the value.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the dictionary with the added key-value pairs.

Explanation:

For example, if the given N is 3, read the inputs in the next three lines, if the given three inputs are the following.

Gopal Hockey
Jyothi Cricket
Akhil Football

Your code should print the dictionary with all the key-value pairs. 

So the output should be

{'Ram': 'Cricket', 'Naresh': 'Football', 'Vani': 'Tennis', 'Rahim': 'Cricket', 'Gopal': 'Hockey', 'Jyothi': 'Cricket', 'Akhil': 'Football'}
